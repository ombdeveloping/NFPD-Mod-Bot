"""Entry point.

Startup order is deliberate:

    1. configure logging, so every later failure is reported the same way
    2. start the health server, so /health answers probes immediately and /ready
       reports 503 while dependencies come up
    3. wait for Postgres (retrying, not crashing) - commands are useless without it
    4. connect to Discord

Shutdown is driven by SIGTERM, which is what `docker stop` sends. Python's default
SIGTERM handling kills the process outright without unwinding, so the pool would
never be closed; an explicit handler turns it into an orderly shutdown instead.
